What Was Done in This Project?

1. Data Preparation

- Imported raw Excel data into Power BI
- Cleaned the dataset by:
  - Handling missing values
  - Standardizing data types (dates, numbers)
  - Removing unnecessary columns
- Created derived fields such as:
  - Month from Order Date
  - Order Count
  - Return Rate

2. Data Modeling & Measures

- Built key measures using DAX:
  - Total Revenue
  - Total Orders
  - Average Order Value
  - Return Rate %
Ensured correct aggregations for analysis and visuals.

3. Dashboard Design

Created a multi-page interactive dashboard with:
- KPI Cards for quick business overview.
